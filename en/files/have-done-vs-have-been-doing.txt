ðŸ“Œ HAVE DONE vs HAVE BEEN DOING ðŸ“Œ

Oh iya,

I forgot to mention the difference between them.



Have done is about how many.

âœ…I have read a lot of books





Have been doing is about how long

âœ…I have been reading this book for 3 days


Oh iya, 1 lagi 


Kita pake have been doing untuk hal yang baruuuuuu aja selesai terjadi, dan kita kayak masih bisa lihat efeknya.


Contoh:
Kita lihat temen kita kok kayak capek gitu. Terus kita tanya,


You look so tired. Have you been working all night?


Kamu kok kayaknya capek. Kamu barusan kerja semalaman ya?
