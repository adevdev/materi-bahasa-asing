*-- OTHER,  ANOTHER,  or THE OTHER?? --*

Some people are still perplexed by these words. I hope my brief explanation will help you distinguish them. To make it clear,  I'll use both English and Bahasa Indonesia. 

*_Another_* is used for singular countable noun. It means "one more". It is also used with expressions of time,  distance,  and money although they usually take plural nouns. 

For example:

Can I borrow _another_ five dollars? 
We still need to wait for _another_ 30 minutes.

*_Other/Others_* is used for plural countable noun. It is also used for uncountable noun. 

For example:

Can I have some _other_ sugar,  please?

*_The other_ and _The others_* are used for both countable and uncountable nouns. It indicates the remaining things. 

To make it clear,  let's see how they are used:

1. I have 3 pens.  The blue pen is mine. Another pen is yours. The other pen belongs to my sister. 

2. I have 8 books.  The pink book is mine. Another (only one book) one is yours. Three other books (you can also say "3 others") are hers. The other books (you can also say "The others) are Juna's, Lisa's,  and Andy's. 

Jadi....... 
Kalau dilihat dari contoh yang kedua, 
Ada 8 buku. Yang pink punyaku. _Satu lagi_ (another)  itu punya kamu. _Tiga yang lain_ (other *tanpa* _the_) itu punya dia.  Dan _sisanya_ (the other) punya Juna,  Lisa,  dan Andy. 

*Other* (tanpa s)  digunakan kalo bendanya disebutkan. Kalo menambahkan -s,  berarti benda tidak disebutkan. 

Three *other books*. Three *others*.
Berlaku juga untuk *The others*.
