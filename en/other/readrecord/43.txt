A Late Night

I am so sleepy today. I stayed up too late last night. My grandmother is visiting for the weekend. We had a special party for her birthday. We invited our relatives. My mom cooked her favorite food and baked a cake. We played games and looked at old pictures. My grandmother opened her gifts. She enjoyed the evening. Everyone stayed for a long time. My mom said to sleep early. I asked her if I could stay up. She said I could stay up for another hour. After an hour, I tried to sleep. I closed my eyes, but I couldn't fall asleep. I stared at the clock. I finally fell asleep after midnight.
