         *HALLUCINATION*


Hallucinations are sensory experiences that appear real but are created by your mind. They can affect all five of your senses. For example, you might hear a voice that no one else in the room can hear or see an image that isn’t real.

These symptoms may be caused by mental illnesses, the side effects of medications, or physical illnesses like epilepsy or alcohol use disorder.

You may need to visit a psychiatrist, a neurologist, or a general practitioner depending on the cause of your hallucinations.

Treatment may include taking medication to treat a health condition. Your doctor may also recommend adopting different behaviors like drinking less alcohol and getting more sleep to improve your hallucinations.
