*READING PRATICES* 

*I bake many different foods like cookies, cakes, pies, bread, and muffins. I spend my time working in the kitchen, where I keep all my tools. I use things like mixing bowls, measuring cups, spoons, pans, and of course the oven! I also have many ingredients in my kitchen like sugar, flour, eggs, and salt. I follow my recipes carefully to make lots of yummy baking! People ask me to bake things for them. I love to make birthday cakes for parties! I bake different kinds of cakes like chocolate and vanilla, then cookies decorate them with icing. I also love to bake cookies and cupeakes for special holidays.*
