*A Group Project*

I am so annoyed with my friend Stephanie. She is so irresponsible. We are working together on a class project and she never helps. Each person was assigned a task for the project. She didn't do her share. Yesterday, we had a group meeting at the library to complete our project. We agreed to meet after school. We all went to the library, but she wasn't there. She didn't show up. We had to finish without her. I called her home. Her mom said she was at a friend's house. I saw her at school the next day. She said she didn't know about the meeting but I know she wasn't telling the truth. We reminded her many times. I really don't want work with her anymore.
