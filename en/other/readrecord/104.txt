*Value Of Time* 🕗
Time is more than money as money spent can be earned again however once time spent can never be earned. There is a common saying that “Time and Tide waits for none”. It is as true as existence of life on the earth. Time runs continuously without stoppage. It never waits anyone. So, we should never spend our precious and priceless time without purpose and meaning at any stage of our life. We should always understand the meaning of time and use it accordingly in positive way to fulfill some purpose. We should learn something from this continuously running time. If it runs regularly without any stoppage, then why we cannot.
