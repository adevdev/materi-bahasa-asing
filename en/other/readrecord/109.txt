 *A lot of people like to go out, because they want to relax and get some new impressions. Many people prefer to go to cafes or restaurants. I'm no exception. I like to go to cafes and coffee shops very much. I rarely go to restaurants, because they are usually quite expensive and pretty crowded. Of course a restaurant menu is a lot more diverse. But for me personally the atmosphere is more important than the food. I usually choose a small but cozy cafe with unique atmosphere. I have a couple of my favorite cafes With very nice interior design. I usually have a big cup of coffee , a cake or some snack. While sipping coffee I study carefully every small detail of the café. My thoughts fly far away and I forget about my routine.*
