*While you are asleep at night, some people are at work. Night workers do many important jobs. They sleep during the day. Many cleaners work at night. They clean streets, offices and shops while it is quiet and there are not many people around. Road workers keep our roads safe to drive on. They often repair roads during the night when there is very little traffic. Some railway workers work at night, too. Some reporters need to work during the night to make sure that all the news is up to date. Hospital patients need to be looked after twenty-fouur hours a day. Many doctors, nurses need to work at night. Fires, accidents and other emergencies can happen at any time. So there are always firefighters, police and ambulance workers on duty.*
