It teaches us to use a language properly. We don’t know a huge amount of words and their means. Reading introduces us with these words and lets us use them in our conversations. There are books on culture, health, history, education, geography, travel, psychology, art, and traditions and all these books enrich our knowledge. We acquire amazing knowledge from reading these books.
