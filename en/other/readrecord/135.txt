Reading practice 

Anna

I am Anna, I am 16 years old and a student. In the morning I get up shortly before 7 o'clock. I can't wake up by myself. An alarm clock rings me out of my sleep. I get up and the first thing I usually have to do is go to the bathroom. I wash my face. Then I take a shower, first with warm water and then with cold water. That way I get really awake. I also have to brush my teeth, and then I get dressed. I have already laid out my clothes the night before. I don't want to lose any time in the morning. So I can get up a little later.

I never skip breakfast, I'm hungry in the morning. I usually eat cereal or toast with jam. I drink tea or coffee with it. Before I go to school, I have to make my bed. But that rarely takes more than a minute or two. Then I run off to my school bus.

After school I have lunch and come home in the afternoon. Then I usually have to do homework. Before dinner I have time to play or meet friends. Then we have dinner together. Before I go to bed, I watch a little TV. Then I go to sleep and sleep from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. in the morning.
