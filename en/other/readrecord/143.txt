*Now i'm leaving home. Don't ask me to stay, I'm picking up my stuff to never come back here again.The day that you can, you send me the stuff I left. This time I'm leaving home. To never come back. This is not worth it anymore. Here all down and heart-broken. But who cares? It's part of life. I will remember all the good times. Those times that will never come back. Throw away the things I gave you. All presents and letters I wrote to you. Forget all the good times we had. Everything has an end. This love will be remembered by me but soon I will love someone else. I wish this had never ended, but this is life and it is what it is. Forget all about me and the happy days we had. Someone else will replace You and so I will be replaced. I really loved you but I have to say good-bye.*
