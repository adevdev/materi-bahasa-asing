My Day


Today I woke up early and took a shower. I cooked breakfast. I had scrambled egg and toasted bread. I had warm milk too. After breakfast I cleaned the table and washed the dishes. I listened to the news on the radio. I cleaned the house. I was a bit tired so I ate some pizza. I drunk some orange juice. I sat on the sofa I turned on the TV. While watching my mom called on the phone. She wanted to eat out with me. We had dinner at the Chinese restaurant. After dinner we came back home and ate some ice cream. I like chocolate flavour but my mom bought vanilla flavour. I don't mind eating vanilla ice cream. It was a great day. I took a bath and feel sleepy. I want to go to bed now. That's for today.
