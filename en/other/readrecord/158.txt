The main part of the ship doesnâ€™t break. The ship is very big. It looks very similar to Vasa. Vasa is another warship from 1628. Vasa is the best preserved ship in the world. It is 69 meters long. It sinks on its first journey. The ship sails only 900 meters. Archaeologists will leave Applet in the sea. The work to take it out is difficult. It could break.
