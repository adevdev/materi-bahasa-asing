Reading practice 

Either gray or blue 

The renovations in my new office are almost done. I just need to decide what color to make the door. I rented this office a month ago and wanted to freshen it up a bit. It's very big and it's close to the banks. Since I'm a tax accountant, I have to have an office near the banks as well as downtown. I also put up a big sign with my name on it, because that's how I get more customers. For the past two weeks, the craftsmen have been working diligently in the office, fulfilling my demanding requests. I am not only satisfied, but also thrilled with what can be done in two weeks. A very good friend recommended the guys from this company to me and he was right, they are real professionals. On Monday, I'm having an opening party at the new office. I'm inviting not only my family, but also friends and colleagues.
