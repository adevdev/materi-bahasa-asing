Austria 

In summer, many people like to travel to Austria. Especially in Vienna and Salzburg, tourists from all over the world gather to go to concerts, visit museums and take short hikes outside the cities. In Vienna, tourists prefer to visit St. Stephen's Cathedral and Sch√∂nbrunn Palace; in Salzburg, especially the Hohensalzburg Fortress and the house where composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born.

People who travel to Austria like to sleep in hotels, which is why some hotels are fully booked in the summer. Other people like to stay in youth hostels or rent apartments where they have to take care of themselves. On the Internet they compare prices and find the cheapest and the best offer for them in the city. They are often surprised because supermarkets in Austria are not open on weekends and at night. Nevertheless, most tourists like it very much in Vienna and Salzburg, after all, many also like to come back to Austria.
