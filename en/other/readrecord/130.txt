Snowy Owl in Montreal

A traffic camera captured stunning footage of a snowy owl in Montreal, Canada. The majestic visitor has delighted viewers with the video gaining over 15,000 likes and 18,000 shares on Facebook. The reason the sighting attracted so much attention is not just the beauty of the video, but also because seeing snowy owls is quite rare, as they tend to inhabit places where humans do not live. Moreover, the snowy owl is an official symbol of Quebec and people protect it from hunters in Canada, though the birds are occasionally killed in collisions with cars, airplanes and utility lines.
