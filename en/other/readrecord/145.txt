Read and Record

It's not whether you're right or wrong, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong.

It is much easier to put existing resources to better use, than to develop resources where they do not exist.

Markets are constantly in a state of uncertainty and flux and money is made by discounting the obvious and betting on the unexpected.

I wish I could write a book that will be read for as long as our civilization lasts... I would value it much more highly than any business success if I could contribute to an understanding of the world in which we live or, better yet, if I could help to preserve the economic and political system that has allowed me to flourish as a participant.

I'm only rich because I know when I'm wrong.
