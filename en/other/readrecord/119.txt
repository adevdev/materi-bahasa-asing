Emotional Intelligence

Have you developed your emotional intelligence to its fullest? One of the most critical elements for a student’s success in school is an understanding of how to learn. The key factors for this understanding include confidence, self-motivation and self-control, the capacity to communicate, and the ability to work well with others. Successful employees exhibit these same skills on an even higher level. Many corporations now include emotional intelligence in training programs to help employees cooperate, motivate, and collaborate more, thereby increasing productivity and profits.
To start boosting your emotional intelligence, evaluate yourself to determine if you are self-motivating, take initiative, set goals and priorities, can recognize other people’s feelings (and their nonverbal cues), and work well with others. If your emotional intelligence is well developed, that will directly impact all your other abilities in a positive way.
