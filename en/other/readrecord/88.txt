*Kindness*

Kindness is a simple way to connect with people around us. We interact with many people in a day. Most of them are strangers to us. We don't know them, but we can make them love and respect us. It is possible only through kindness.

Your kindness can make you different from others. Kindness can put a beautiful smile on othersâ€™ faces. Their internal satisfaction is also an appropriate measure of your kindness.

A simple act of kindness can help you with feeling and spreading happiness around you. It can be done by simply praising others. We can praise them for their look, attire, their language, their behaviour, their work, etc.

Being kind does not cost anything instead it provides respect, happiness, and satisfaction. You will also get their love, trust, and support as well. We all need a change, but that change is possible only through kindness.
