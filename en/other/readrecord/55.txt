My First Piano Recital

I had my first piano recital today. I was nervous and afraid. I practiced almost every day for three months, but I was still not confident. My parents and piano teacher said I was ready, but I didn't want to do it. My whole family was there to watch me. They were in the front row. I wanted to cry, but I held back my tears. My mom came backstage and comforted me. She told me she was very nervous at her first piano recital too. She said that it was normal to feel nervous. She said I could continue or skip the recital. She gave me a hug and I felt better. I went on stage and played my songs. Everyone clapped and took many pictures. I bowed and walked off the stage. I was really nervous, but I didn't make any mistakes. My piano teacher called me in the evening and said I did a great job. She said I could practice the next lesson or take a break next week. I chose to keep practicing. I love playing the piano.
