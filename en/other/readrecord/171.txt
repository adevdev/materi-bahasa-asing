🎤 Read and Record 🎤

If you're truly eager to learn English, open your mouth to speak. Reading, listening, and writing are helpful but to learn to speak, you have to speak. Just like, if you want to be a good reader, you have to read, to be a good writer, you have to write, to be a good listener, you have to listen, same is the case with speaking. If you want to speak, open your mouth. You have no other options.
