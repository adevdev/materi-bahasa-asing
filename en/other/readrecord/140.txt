*READING PRATICES* 

*It's important to stay healthy. We should care for Our body from when we are young to when we are old. If we eat well, and walk or do sport, we probably won't get sick very often. We can help ourselves to stay healthy. Others can help us, too, if we are sick or disabled, or if we have an accident. When people are old, sick or disabled, they often need help with cooking, cleaning, shopping, washing clothes and taking medication. They can get help at home from other people in the family or from care workers. Sometimes, they have to live in a care home.*
