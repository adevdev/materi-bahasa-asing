☕°○Don't let your life go by unnoticed. Life is made of moments full of beauty and magic, waiting for us to notice. You must not let the distractions and busy ness keep you from experiencing everything this beautiful life has to offer. Get out into nature, slow it all down. Watch more sunrises with the only intent of watching the sun gloriously rise. Look at your
partner's face deeply and tenderly, with the only intent of truly seeing them. When life feels like it's spinning around and you can't catch up, return to the beautiful moment of now, where everything is exactly as it should be.

 Notice your breathing, notice where you are Release. Breathe. Feel.
