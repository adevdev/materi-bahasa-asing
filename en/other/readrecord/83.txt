NAUGHTY JOHN - Mischief

 John was a very notorious boy. He was very fond of chocolates. One day he went to his neighbour who gave him some chocolates to eat. He felt very happy, quickly ate up all of them and asked for more.
The aunty got angry and said that she had no more chocolates left. Then John pointed out to a box in the cupboard and asked, "Then what is there in that box?" "That box is filled with insects", replied the aunty. Later that day, on getting an opportunity, he ate up all the chocolates in the box and filled it with many insects.
When aunty came to know about it, she got very angry and scolded him.
