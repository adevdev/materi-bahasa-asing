*READING PRACTICES*

*It’s all about perspective. Everybody is so wrapped up in, I’m right, you’re wrong there is no room for civil discussion, let alone compromise, understanding, or compassion. If you are having a problem with someone, put yourself in their place and try to see/hear/feel where they’re coming from and you may have a better chance at resolving the issue. Your mind is your best asset. Intelligent minds don’t always get ahead, but brave minds do. If fear is too strong, the genius is suppressed. Great opportunities are not seen with your eyes. They are seen with your mind. Become a possibilitarian. No matter how dark things seem to be or actually are, raise your sights and see possibilities. Always see them, for they're always there.*
