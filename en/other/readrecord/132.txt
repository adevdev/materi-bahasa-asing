A robot makes fries


In California, US, Miso Robotics developed a robot which works in fast food restaurants. At first, the robot only turned burgers, but workers soon realized that it could do more tasks. Now, the robot does several tasks at once. For example, it prepares french fries or onion rings. When an order comes, a worker sends instructions to the robot. The robot uses special arms that look similar to those in car factories. The robot‚Äôs advantage can do many tasks at the same time, which saves a lot of time and work. The robot uses AI and cameras and is faster than humans. It prepares meals for the right amount of time, and people are happy that they don‚Äôt have to do the work, especially at night.
