🖐BREAKING A BAD HABIT🖐

I have a habit of biting my fingernails. My parents would scold me every time they noticed I chewed my nails. I should stop biting them, but it's a hard habit to break. Sometimes, I don't realize I am doing it. I usually do it when I'm feeling anxious about something. My parents say it is a bad habit because nails carry germs that make people ill. My mother tried putting nail polish on my nails. She was hoping that it would taste bitter, but it did not work. The taste did not bother me. My dad told me to put gloves on, but that only made me hot. What shall I do? I will keep trying to stop. I think it would be easier if my parents did not pressure me about it. My sister used to bite her nails. She does not do it anymore. Maybe, I will break the habit soon.
