*Importance of satisfactionÂ in our life*

Some people believe self-satisfaction is a costly affair. They think itâ€™s hard to be satisfied with their achievements. Because they just canâ€™t be. Believe it or not, a thought process like this will only lead to pain. You will feel restless or lack confidence. Satisfaction is important because it helps us develop faith in ourselves. If we donâ€™t learn to admire our achievements, weâ€™ll never be able to be satisfied. Weâ€™ll feel like we are falling behind, which will ultimately lead to depression.

If you want to live your whole life with a feeling of incompleteness, thatâ€™s your wish. But itâ€™s not going to do anything good for you. Instead of counting your failures, focus on your gains, both monetary and nonmonetary ones. Try to pick moments of your life that make you happy. Live your life to the fullest and wipe out the grim memories. Life brings new opportunities now and then. Satisfaction is important because we want to be happy and get ready for new possibilities.
