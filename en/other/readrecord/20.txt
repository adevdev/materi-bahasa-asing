Education is one of the most important things in our lives. Don’t you agree? It can make the difference between success and failure. An education can bring us knowledge and make us rich. In rich countries, people are lucky to have good schools. Children start learning from a very young age. They can further their education and go to higher education or university. In Japan, there are even private schools for babies to learn good English. It’s a shame that in many rich countries, many children don’t want to learn. Perhaps schools need to find better ways to teach, so that children may want to learn. It’s sad that in many parts of the world, children want to learn but they end up giving up. So try not to stop learning. Education is the key to a better future.
