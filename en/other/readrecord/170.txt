*ðŸ”–Reading PracticeðŸ”–* 

*I work at a restaurant. At my job, I am very busy all day. My restaurant makes hamburgers, fried chicken, soup, and salad. I do not make the food, but I do serve the food to the customers. I bring the customers drinks, and then I ask them what they would like to eat. The customers tell me their order. I write it down in my small notebook, and then I type the order into the computer. The cooks in the kitchen receive the order, and they make the food. I bring the food to the table. Everyone in town thinks the food at my restaurant is delicious. I agree. My favorite food is the fried chicken.*
