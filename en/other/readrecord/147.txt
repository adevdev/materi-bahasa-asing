*READING PRACTICES*

*There stood a little lighthouse in the middle of the sea on top of the rocks. Its light shone far out to sea but no ship had passed by for years. So one day, the lighthouse keeper left it and went away. The lighthouse was very sad at being left all alone. The seals and walruses who lived near the rocks felt sorry for the lonely lighthouse. They decided to take turns at working the light of the lighthouse. This way it would keep shining and not feel lonely. The lighthouse was happy on hearing this. Since then, every night the lighthouse shone its light and the dolphins, seals, walruses, and even a few whales, came out to play in its light. They all had a wonderful time. With so many friend, the little house was never lonely after that.*
