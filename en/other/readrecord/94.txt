TRANSFERRING TO ANOTHER CLASS


He does not like Ms. Garcia, his math teacher. She always separates him from his classmates. She always give him a lot of homework. She always calls him mean names. She never helps him. He drops out of Ms. Garcia's class. He transfers to Ms. Moore's class. She is much better.
