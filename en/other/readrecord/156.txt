Sharing the load
Relieve stress by learning to
delegate better 

Team leaders must think
about goals and how to
achieve them. This takes
time. You won't have this
thinking time if you're busy
doing routine tasks and you
will feel stressed. You have to let your team members handle the everyday tasks. Show your team members you trust them. Ask them if they could show you a plan of how they can manage
their work in their own way. This way you will build a better working relationship.
