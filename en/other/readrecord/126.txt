We live in a world where learning English as a second language is essential. Not only for professional growth, but a second language brings possibilities to get to know a new culture. However, Learning English is much more than simply memorizing the translation of words into your language. This implies a total understanding of the language structure. The language is always rooted in the culture from which it comes. Therefore, you do not expect to be able to learn English without having adopted certain criteria and thoughts of the new culture in question.
