ðŸ“– *READING PRACTICE* ðŸ“–
It was such a nice day, I stayed outside all day. In the morning, I went for a walk with my brother and our dog. Then, we came home and my mom made us lunch. We wanted to have a picnic in the backyard. My mom made sandwiches. We laid out a blanket on the grass. After we finished our lunch, my brother and I threw away our trash. My mom came outside with us to work in the yard. There was a storm last weekend so it was still a mess. The wind blew a lot of debris onto the lawn. I helped to rake the lawn and my brother mowed the grass. Many weeds grew in the garden this week. I pulled the weeds and my mom planted some new flowers. Then my dad came home after work. We decided to have a barbecue. We cooked hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill and relaxed in the yard. I'm so glad the weather is nice again.
