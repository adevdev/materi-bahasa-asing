A Long Road Trip

My family and I took a long road trip across the country. We traveled by both train and RV. We took the train to my grandparent's house first. My grandfather picked us up at the train station. We borrowed their RV and traveled to other parts of the country. We either stayed in the RV or in motels at night. We saw many tourist attractions. Not only, did we go sightseeing, but we also visited our relatives. It was both fun and busy. I brought my camera and took pictures of famous buildings and skyscrapers. I'm very fascinated by them. I may want to be an architect one day. My dad brought his video camera, so he took both pictures and videos of our trip. My brother didn't have any fun. He neither likes traveling nor sightseeing. This was both a wonderful and memorable experience. I will never forget it. At the end of our trip, we drove back to my grandparent's house. We said good-bye to my grandparents at the train station. We were all ready to go home. We were not only tired, but also homesick. I miss my own bed.
