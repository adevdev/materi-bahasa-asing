🐶My wish for a dog 🐶

I wanted a dog for my birthday, but my parents did not want one. They said dogs were high maintenance. I think they are so cute. They are the best animals in the world. They are loyal and good protectors. I like big dogs. Big dogs protect people better than small dogs. My dad said he had a dog when he was a child. He said it was the worst dog in the world. It never listened and tried to run away many times. I told my dad that dogs need proper training. My dad suggested that we get a fish. I didn't want a fish. They are boring. I think dogs are better pets than fish. My mom agreed with my dad. She said that fish are less maintenance than big dogs. I told them I would help take care of a dog. They said they wanted to get a pet that is the least amount of work. Every time I talked to them, I felt worse than before. I stopped asking for a dog. Then, one day I came home from school and there was a puppy in our living room. He had a big bow on his head. My parents surprised me with a puppy on my birthday. I asked if he could sleep on my bed. He is so cuddly. I have the best parents in the world.
