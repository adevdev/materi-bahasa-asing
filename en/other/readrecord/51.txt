A Visit to the Zoo

Our class took a field trip to the zoo last week. My mom was a chaperone. We rode the school bus. I sat with a friend on the bus. My mom sat with the teacher. Each student got a name tag. The zoo was crowded. There were other schools there. We saw many animals. I even saw an ostrich. I really wanted to see a tiger and an elephant. They are my favorite animals. I waited for the tiger, but it never came out. The zoo guide said it was asleep. I was so disappointed. I finally saw an elephant. It was huge. My mom took a picture of it. She took pictures of all the animals. I really enjoy learning about different animals. I think I want to be a veterinarian or a zookeeper one day. I have a desire to take care of them. We have a dog at home. I want to get a cat, but my mom is allergic to them. They make her sneeze. My mom printed all of the pictures for me. I made a scrapbook of all the animals. I labeled each picture. I want to keep it forever.
