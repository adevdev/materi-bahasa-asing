A Visit To The Dentist

My brother and I had dentist appointments today. He was more nervous than me. Sometimes, we have to get shots in our mouths. They don't really hurt, but they make our mouths feel weird. I don't like the feeling. Last time, the dentist found two cavities on my brother's teeth. He was upset, but my mom was more upset than him. The dentist said that he needs to be more consistent with brushing his teeth after meals. I didn't have any cavities last time. I am more careful than my brother. He has had more cavities than me. I really like our dentist. She is the most patient person. My brother likes her too. Sometimes, my brother cries for a long time. He is afraid of pain. She explained to him that crying will make things more painful. She tries to tell jokes during the checkup. Today, she told a really funny joke. That made things more comfortable for us. Today, we didn't have any cavities. We were happy, but my mom was more relieved. Before we left, we each got a new toothbrush and a small toy. Today was the most pleasant visit to the dentist so far.
