John was a very active boy. He loved to play sports and was always running around. He was also very curious and would often ask questions about the world around him.

One day, John was playing in the park when he noticed a strange looking bird. He had never seen a bird like this before and was fascinated by it. He asked his mom what kind of bird it was, and she told him it was a peacock. John was so excited to learn about this new creature and asked his mom to take him to the zoo so he could see more peacocks.
