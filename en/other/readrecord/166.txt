International Day of Persons with Disabilities.


The International Day of Persons with Disabilities happens every year. It highlights issues that are an everyday concern for millions of people around the world. It started in 1992 when the United Nations created the day. There is a different focus every year. In 2006, the theme was disability and information technology; in 2007 it was "Decent Work for Persons with Disabilities"; and in 2008 it was on dignity and justice for those with disabilities. Organizers hope to promote global understanding of disability issues and of the rights and wellbeing of the disabled. People act in many ways to increase awareness, including organizing events, workshops and campaigns in support of the day. Disability affects all societies and almost all families at some time. More than 650 million people across the globe live with disabilities. In richer nations, there are very good support systems for the disabled. However, in poorer nations, people with disabilities are further disabled by a lack of help, care, medicines and rights. It is a sad fact that 80 per cent of people with disabilities live in poorer countries. There is a very strong link between poverty and disability. The situation is also tragic for children. UNESCO says 90 per cent of children with disabilities in developing countries do not go to school. It is important we act on this day and recognize the rights and dignity of people with disabilities.
