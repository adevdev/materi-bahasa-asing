*Shopping at Thrift Shop*

Marina likes clothes. She likes being unique. A lot of girls in her school shop at the same stores. Marina hates to have the same outfit as another girl's. That is why she shops at thrift shops. 

A thrift shop sells things that people donate. They are usually clothes that have been worn before. Sometimes there are stains and holes on the clothes. They are very cheap. 

Marina enjoys looking through clothing racks. She usually finds at least one thing she likes. Last weekend she found a dress. It was black and long. She thought it would be good to wear to a fancy dinner.
