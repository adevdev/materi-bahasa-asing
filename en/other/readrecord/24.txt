My doctor

I have a doctor's appointment on Wednesday. It is just a routine checkup. The last time I had to see the doctor was in August. It was during summer vacation. I fell off my bike and broke my arm. It was very painful, but my doctor was very nice. His name is Dr. Taylor. He is funny and very smart. He graduated from Harvard Medical School. He speaks three different languages: English, Spanish, and German. His parents are from England and Germany, but he was born in Spain. I know a lot about him because he is not only my doctor, but also my uncle. I call him Uncle Simon. Although he is a busy doctor, he visits our family often. He comes over every Christmas. Last Christmas he took my brother and me to watch Batman. This winter I hope he takes us to the movie theater again. He also reads to us. My favorite book is Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He is the coolest uncle and doctor. I want to be like him when I grow up.
