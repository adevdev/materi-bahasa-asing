It's time to get down to business and work on that big dream of yours. Which one? Any one of them. All of them! Whatever you do, make sure that you start setting a plan in motion to accomplish something that has been dormant in your mind, but is still an ember in your heart. This may be the answer to a lot of what you need in your life. You may have started, stopped, started, stopped - but now you have to start and keep going until you go as far as you can with it. This could bring the change you need.
