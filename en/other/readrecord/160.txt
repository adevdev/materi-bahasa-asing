A bicultural child

When my parents met, it was love at first sight. And they knew exactly that they wanted to spend their lives together. My father is Swiss and my mother is Japanese. I am the product of their love that brought balance to the family. At the beginning of their marriage, it was a little hard for both of them, because these are two completely different cultures that had come together. But each of them respected the other's culture as a whole and never attacked it. I am happy to be a bicultural child and I own two nationalities. It's always interesting when we talk about our families at school. I always have one of the best stories there. During the school year, I'm in Zurich almost all the time, and during the vacations I fly to visit my grandparents in Tokyo. Although it's very far, they also come to visit us often. It is very important to spend time with the family.
