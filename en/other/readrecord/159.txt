I am special.Â Nobody in the world is exactly like I am.Â They might have the same colour hair and eyes that I do, but they are not exactly like me.Â I am the only person in the world who thinks my thoughts.Â No two people in the world are exactly alike.Â It is good to be your own person.Â It is good to be creative and be natural.Â People have to follow the laws and the rules.Â People should always be kind to others.Â I try to follow all the rules.Â I am kind to others.Â I am a lot like many other people, yet I am different.Â I am like my friend Jane, but she has red hair and I have dark hair.Â She has a loud voice, and I have a soft voice.Â She likes to eat vegetables, and I do not.Â Jane and I are the same height.Â We both like movies, and we are both afraid of spiders.Â We wear the same size shoes, and we both have the same favorite colour.Â We are best friends, but sometimes we disagree about things.Â We are alike in many ways, and different in many ways.
