"Today, I will relax"

 
A day at the beach for everyone is endless fun, playing, running, looking at the ocean, the palm trees, the breeze flowing through water. All of this is a treat. Jessica came early in the morning to the beach even when there was no one. She wanted to feel and see every changing colour of magnificent nature, roar of the ocean was touching her heart deeply, as the day moved forward she enjoyed the joy of others and witnessed bright reflection of sun on the water until it became golden red before setting off. A day at the beach for Jessica meant a lot, more than anyone else. It was her first time witnessing all of this, she had an eye transplant a week ago; she could see now for the first time in 27 years.
