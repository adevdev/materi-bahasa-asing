A school fundraiser

My school is doing a fundraiser. We are trying to raise money for new gym equipment. We need money to replace all of the old and worn-out athletic gear. Half the items have not been updated for many years. We are putting on a concert. All of the proceeds from the ticket sales will go to the Physical Education department. My brother is a singer. He is going to sing with his friend. Both of them are really good singers. They sound like professional musicians. Anyone can participate in the concert. Our music teacher is organizing this event. She is working with the school coach. Both teachers are excited to support this school function. Also, half the school has signed up to have a part in the concert. All of the students have great school spirit. I hope we raise enough money to help the PE department. PE and Music are usually the last departments to get any money from the school budget. Both departments need a lot of support. Academics are important. But PE and Music are important too. Maybe, this fundraiser will motivate all of us to do another one for the Music department.
