*READING PRATICES*

*Letting go means accepting that something better is meant for you, it means a Deep End appreciating your worth and moving on, it means having faith in life and the lessons you must learn. Letting go means choosing love over heartbreak, choosing happiness over pain, and choosing yourself over them. Letting go means believing in yourself and loving yourself enough to walk away. Letting go means choosing your happiness over everything, because you know you that you deserve it, and because you know that eventually-you will heal.*
